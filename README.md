# Granule

A WordPress starter theme.

It's the code I use to start all of my [Pro Theme Design](https://prothemedesign.com) themes.

The theme was initially based on Darren Hoyts Gravy theme, but has evolved over many years of developing themes for wordpress.com. It now takes inspiration from _s as being a simple theme to use as a starting point for creating new themes.

Things to note:

* It is not a theme framework or a parent theme.
* The theme code does not care about backwards compatibility. There's no need since the theme is not a parent theme.
* The code always supports the latest version of WordPress.
