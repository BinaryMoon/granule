# Granule

A WordPress starter theme.

It's the code I use to start all of my [Pro Theme Design](https://prothemedesign.com) themes.

The theme was initially based on Darren Hoyts Gravy theme, but has evolved over many years of developing themes for wordpress.com. It now takes inspiration from _s as being a simple theme to use as a starting point for creating new themes.
